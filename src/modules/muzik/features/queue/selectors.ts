 * Single source of truth for the **Up Next** count: the number of queued videos

 *
 * Counting "items that aren't the current one" is wrong — completed tracks linger
 * in the queue (auto-advance keeps them), so they sit BEFORE the current item and
 * must not be counted. Counting by position excludes the current track, any
 * completed tracks before it, and resolves to 0 when nothing is playing.
 *
 *   [A▶]            → 0
 *   [A▶, B]         → 1
 *   [A▶, B, C]      → 2
 *   [done, A▶, B]   → 1   (the completed track is not counted)
